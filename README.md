# FE15-CR4

This project consists only a landing page. HTML with bootstrap, SCSS and JS were used.

To view the pages simply clone this repo then open index.html in your browser.

This project was done as a solution to a end of the week project during my fullstack course at code factory - the focus for this project was the usage of JS and JSON.

Please view the assignment.pdf to view the expected results.

Cheers!



ps. Details about functionality:

switching priority by clicking on the symbol.
sort priority in 3 ways possible: first press = high to low, second press = low to high, third one = back to normal(by task id) = Symbol changes for each step

extras:
Delete button - deletes the task from html and set this property in array
Done button - toggle the task to done <-> open
Generate new task - as it named :-)

after reload the page or press the reset button, all changes undo
